# Sentiment-Analysis

Exciting sentiment analysis project! My colleagues and I analyzed tweet sentiments and constructed a robust sentiment analysis model using advanced techniques like natural language processing, machine learning, and neural networks. After exploratory data analysis, we implemented LSTM and DistilBERT approaches. Check out Part 1 and Part 2! Enjoy! 🚀🧑‍💻📊🧠🤖

The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
